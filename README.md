blog
====
Skills: HTML5, CSS, PHP, MySql.

This is the very first webpage I designed and developed during the first month of webdev education. The assignment was to make a personal blog with a backend. The website is developed from scratch in HTML5, without any frameworks. It has a simple backend with a database that allows you to upload blogposts, select categories to tag the posts, and basic formatting support. All the login fields are protected against basic SQL injections and scripts. 

Blog has comment functionality, which is animated with javascript so you can open/close the comment section directly under article without needing to open it in a separate window. I also added basic portfolio and contact sections. 

I set out to design a clean and simple website - a task taht I succeeded in. All in all, it was a good effort and result for a week long project with no prior experience in webdev, however it needs some polish for me to use as my personal page, which takes time during current quick pace of the education. I am not satisfied with some solutions I used and will revisit this page later.
